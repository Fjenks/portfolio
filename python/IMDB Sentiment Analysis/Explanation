Sentiment analysis model to analyze IMDB reviews. Worked with a team but all of the code included is written by me. 
The text compress file was used to take the data in it's original form, thousands of individual text files in folders, and compress
it into two more manageable files containing all the texts.
The task we performed was to process the text using TF-IDF to determine word relevency. We tested several hyperparameters such as 
restricting max features in min df in the model. Once we found the best pre processing parameters, we tested several different Sklearn 
models including logistic regression, Linear SVC, and decision trees. 
Our final prediction accuracy was 88%, tested through a K-Fold validation pipeline.
