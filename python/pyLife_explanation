Simple life simulation. Green pixels are plants that grow over time. White pixels are herbivores that travel in herds and eat plants.
Red pixels are carnivores that travel randomly until they reach a certain hunger, and then hunt herbivores.
Starting conditions can be adjusted to observe how the outcome is affected.
Hypothetical outcomes:
  Balance achieved
  Too many carnivores, prey die out and then carnivores do as well.
  Too many prey, plants cannot sustain them, they die out and then carnivores do.
