With this model I worked with a team to analyze reddit comments to produce a popularity prediction model. 
The whole project involved splitting the text and extracting features, building a linear regression and gradient descent model from scratch,
and performing several experiments to achieve optimal prediction accuracy.
I assisted with debugging and research for the whole project but my primary contribution was in section 3 of the code, the experimental
stage of the task.
